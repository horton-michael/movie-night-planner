# Movie-Night-Planner

## Description

Our team built this project in order to help solve a problem Mason Thompson incounters with his friends during weekly movie nights. 
In doing so we were all able to apply new skill sets that we've learned in the past modules. This is what motivated us to build this project. To watch something we create come to life and know it will help Mason Thompson when he hosts movie night with his friends. And this would be a totally new experience for all of us working as a team to build this web application. We were all eagered to learn how to build this project through Git, our own issue branches and request PR's and merge them to structure our application. We had to understand Mason's point of view on his incounterments during his hosting event for a movie nights.  Like everyone else it does become difficult to select a movie to watch, especially if you're deciding it over multiple people. This was one of the problems Mason faced. He'd gather once a week for Movie Night and normally it's consist of lively discussions debating their opinions on a film. Of course it is difficult to come up on the spot with a proper movie of everyones liking especially when there are hundreds of options. Soon enough until you run out of ideas. This is were we step in and help address their conflicts. Our application will solve thier problems for movie Night. We've built an application to steamly search movies based on their interest on certain criterias. These criterias were genre, year range, duration and type. They'd be introduced to a set of results based on their selecting options making it a more simply way to choose what to watch on Movie Night. Many operations/functions were creating in order to get this application running and to have proper structure. We learned how to set these new skills in order to build this application. We learned to work with a different CSS framwork other than Bootstrap, Materialize CSS. This helped add style to our page with well designed components and CSS. It also included interactve components which were set for when Mason and his friends could select the options for thier movie chose. We learned how to set and get items from Local Storage once all options were selected in order for us to output the movies options through an api call and render function. Our teamed learned how to properly use API calls from third parties and side servers. This allowed us to get proper data to later assign what our variables would be called for and set their values. For example, movie title, movie overview/description, movie poster image, movie release date and movie time duration. We all created proper functions to use this date when user, Mason, would select his options to search a Movie. The following results would be rendered into card elements in which we learned how to build that function to display individually each card with its assigned movie title, movie overview/description, and movie poster image.
